# Spells
Repository for paper in progress: Riffe, T.; Lorenti, A.; and Castro, A. "Alignment, clocking, and macro patterns of episodes in the life course"

Accepted to present at PAA 2020, SAA 2020, & EPC 2020, all COVID-19 cancelled.

This repository also contains an experimental R package. To install:
```
library(remotes)
install_github("timriffe/Spells/R/Spells")

library(Spells)
?clock
?align
```
These functions have different options, and they play together nicely with the `tidyverse`.
