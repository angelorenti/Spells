# Spells
Repository for paper in progress: Riffe, T.; Lorenti, A.; and Castro, A. "Alignment, clocking, and macro patterns of episodes in the life course"

Previosuly presented at Statistische Woche 2017, Centre d'estudis demografics 2019

Accepted to present at PAA 2020, SAA 2020, & EPC 2020, all COVID-19 cancelled because we were tired and stressed out.

Submitted to EPC 2022.

Soon to be submitted to a journal :-)

This repository also contains an experimental R package, `Spells`. To install:
```
library(remotes)
install_github("timriffe/Spells/R/Spells")

library(Spells)
?clock
?align
```
These functions have different options, and they play together nicely with the `tidyverse`.
