  state,
  clock_type = c("step", "duration", "order", "identity"),
  increasing = TRUE,

}
\arguments{
\item{x}{character vector of state in each time step}

\item{state}{character. The reference state. Could be a vector of states too.}

\item{clock_type}{character, one of \code{"step"}, \code{"duration"}, \code{"order"}, or \code{"identity"}}

\item{increasing}{logical. Default \code{TRUE}. If \code{clock_type} is either \code{"step"} or \code{"order"} do we count up or count down?}

\item{condition}{character. For duration clocks, one of \code{"total"}, \code{"entry"}, or \code{"exit"}. Default \code{"total"}.}

\item{step_size}{numeric. Default \code{1}. What is the time interval for the discrete bins in \code{x}.}

\item{dead_state}{state name used for the absorbing state}
}
\description{
Given a discrete trajectory, impute clock measures to a given reference state or set of states (treating them ar merged). Clocks include 1) step clocks, those that count up from the start of an episode or down toward the end of it. 2) duration clocks, which record the total episode duration in each time step within the episode. 3) order clocks, which record the episode order in each time step within episodes, and which either count up or down.
}
\details{
Since sometimes we deal with left-censoring, step and duration measures have an option argument \code{not_first} to throw out counting within the very first episode (which may or may not be the reference episode). The argument \code{step_size} is only relevant for duration and step clocks. Discrete time intervals are assumed equal. 

States can be merged by specifying a vector of state names. To merge all states, one can also specify \code{state = "ALL"}. For a prevalence calculation use \code{clock_type = "identity"}, which imputes 1 in the reference state, 0s in all non-dead other states, and \code{NA} for all dead states.

\examples{
x <- rep(c("Employed", "Inactive", "Retired", "Employed", "Retired", 
				"Dead"), c(7,  8,  3,  3, 25,  5))
# a single 8-year spell of inactivity, counting up
clock(x, "Inactive", clock_type = "step", increasing = TRUE)
# a single 8-year spell of inactivity, counting down
clock(x, "Inactive", clock_type = "step", increasing = FALSE)
# two, employment spells, each with its own clock
clock(x, "Employed", clock_type = "step", increasing = TRUE)
# no need to throw out first if counting down:
clock(x, "Employed", clock_type = "step", increasing = FALSE)
# for total durations we do want to throw out the first spell if left censored
clock(x, "Employed", clock_type = "duration")
# TODO: pathological case: inactivity spells not left censored. Need better ID.
clock(x, "Inactivity", clock_type = "duration")

# total duration at entry or exit of spell:
clock(x, "Inactivity", clock_type = "duration", condition = "entry")
clock(x, "Inactivity", clock_type = "duration", condition = "exit")
# merges first consecutive employment and inactivity spells into a single spell,
# also catches second employment after retirement
clock(x, c("Inactive","Employed"), clock_type = "step", increasing = FALSE)
# count down spell order
clock(x, c("Employed"), clock_type = "order", increasing = FALSE)
# again w merged states
clock(x, c("Inactive","Employed"), clock_type = "order", increasing = FALSE)
clock(x, c("Employed"), clock_type = "order", increasing = FALSE)
# total lifespan after 50

clock(x, state = c("Inactive","Employed","Retired"), clock_type = "duration")
# shortcut for the same:
clock(x, "ALL", clock_type = "duration", increasing = FALSE)
# remaining lifespan
clock(x, "ALL", clock_type = "step", increasing = FALSE)
