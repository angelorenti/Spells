#' @title impute clock measures
#' @description Given a discrete trajectory, impute clock measures to a given reference state or set of states (treating them ar merged). Clocks include 1) step clocks, those that count up from the start of an episode or down toward the end of it. 2) duration clocks, which record the total episode duration in each time step within the episode. 3) order clocks, which record the episode order in each time step within episodes, and which either count up or down.
#' @details Since sometimes we deal with left-censoring, step and duration measures have an option argument \code{not_first} to throw out counting within the very first episode (which may or may not be the reference episode). The argument \code{step_size} is only relevant for duration and step clocks. Discrete time intervals are assumed equal. 
#' 
#' States can be merged by specifying a vector of state names. To merge all states, one can also specify \code{state = "ALL"}. For a prevalence calculation use \code{clock_type = "identity"}, which imputes 1 in the reference state, 0s in all non-dead other states, and \code{NA} for all dead states.
#' 
#' @param x character vector of state in each time step
#' @param state character. The reference state. Could be a vector of states too.
#' @param clock_type character, one of \code{"step"}, \code{"duration"}, \code{"order"}, or \code{"identity"}
#' @param increasing logical. Default \code{TRUE}. If \code{clock_type} is either \code{"step"} or \code{"order"} do we count up or count down?
#' @param condition character. For duration clocks, one of \code{"total"}, \code{"entry"}, or \code{"exit"}. Default \code{"total"}.
#' @param step_size numeric. Default \code{1}. What is the time interval for the discrete bins in \code{x}.
#' @param dead_state state name used for the absorbing state
