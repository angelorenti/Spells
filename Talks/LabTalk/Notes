post talk notes:

- be clear on vocabulary: time steps, vs episodes | episodes = spells,
  
- continuous color strips are episodes, divided into time steps.

- state that clocks are random variables (true), but that we don't know the process,
  except by chance in this simple case. Some comparisons with Markov asymptotic 
  results are possible, like mean episode count, state expectancies, state moments,
  but that doesn't cover all clocks, and it covers no alignments. Asymptotic results 
  could be worked out for a toy example, however.
  
- no comparison statistics except to compare quantiles.
